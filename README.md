# 🚀 Modern Data Science Portfolio 

A sleek, highly interactive, and modern portfolio website tailored for Data Science professionals. Built with performance and advanced UI/UX aesthetics in mind, this project demonstrates data analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling expertise through a premium digital experience.

## ✨ Key Features & Aesthetics

This portfolio doesn't just list projects; it provides an immersive user experience utilizing cutting-edge frontend technologies:

*   **Interactive Particle Network:** A custom Canvas-based neural network background that reacts dynamically to user mouse movement, emphasizing the Data Science context.
*   **Dynamic Bento Box Layout:** A clean, asymmetrical, and highly visual grid system used to organize the Technology Stack across logical workflows (Core Languages, ML, Data Wrangling, Environments).
*   **3D Tilt Project Cards:** Immersive 3D hover physics applied to project showcases using Framer Motion.
*   **Advanced Custom Cursor:** An SVG-based cursor featuring spring physics, color inversion (`mix-blend-mode: difference`), and responsive scaling to interactive elements.
*   **Sleek Glassmorphism & UI:** Frosted glass effect cards with beautiful mixed dark gradients, glowing borders, and physics-based magnetic button CTA's.
*   **Fluid Animations:** Smooth, scroll-triggered reveals and a modern fade-up text reel cycling through key data science disciplines.

## 🛠️ Built With Highlights

*   **React 18** & **Vite** (for blazing fast development)
*   **Tailwind CSS** (for precise, highly-customized styling)
*   **Framer Motion** (for complex spring physics and layout animations)
*   **TypeScript** (for robust type safety)
